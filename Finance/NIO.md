Please conduct a thorough analysis of NIO stock using our model structure. 
Begin with a "Risky Assets" module that lists the components "Market LLM," "Report LLM," "Alpha LLM," "News LLM," and "Policy LLM," all of which feed into a "General Agent" that produces an "Asset Return Matrix" flowing into the main central model. 
The analysis should generate five separate sector reports in text: first, a comprehensive company overview report detailing key metrics, performance data, and investment recommendations; second, a financial analysis report covering revenue trends, profit margins, balance sheet data, and cash flow analysis; third, a market sentiment report including analyst ratings, sentiment indicators, and the impact of recent news; fourth, a technical analysis report describing price trends, technical indicators, and support/resistance levels; and fifth, a comparative and value investment report that examines market share, financial metrics versus key competitors, intrinsic value, growth potential, risk factors, and a SWOT analysis with recommendations for different investor types. Conclude with a final prediction report in text on the projected return matrix for purchasing NIO stocks at t+2.

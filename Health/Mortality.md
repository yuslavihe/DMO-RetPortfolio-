### Patient Profile Recap: Zhang Wei

*   Demographics: Male, Born 1948 (Age 75 as of 2023)
*   Diagnosed Conditions:
    *   Hypertension (since ~age 57)
    *   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (since ~age 60)
    *   Hepatic Steatosis (since ~age 62)
    *   Cholelithiasis (since ~age 64)

    *   Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD) (since ~age 70)
    *   Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (since ~age 72)

*   Current Status (Estimated): Moderately controlled BP and HbA1c, Stage 3 CKD, preserved LVEF, cognitive impairment consistent with MCI.

### Methodology & Assumptions

1.  Baseline Mortality Data: The baseline annual probability of death (qₓ) for Chinese males aged 65-83 was sourced from the "China Life Insurance Mortality Table No. 1 (1990-1993) Non-pension Business – Male". While dated, this provides a structured reference point. Annual survival probability (pₓ) = 1 - qₓ. Cumulative survival S(x) = Product(pᵢ) for i = 65 to x-1.
2.  Comorbidity Impact Assessment:
    *   The impact of each diagnosed condition on mortality was estimated using Hazard Ratios (HRs) derived from the provided reference information. Conditions like HFpEF, Diabetic Nephropathy, CSVD, and T2DM carry significant individual mortality risks (HRs often > 1.5-2.0). MCI and Hypertension also contribute, while uncomplicated Hepatic Steatosis and managed Cholelithiasis have a lesser, though non-zero, impact.
    *   Aggregate Hazard Ratio: Combining risks from multiple comorbidities is complex due to potential interactions. A simple multiplicative approach likely overestimates risk. An *aggregate adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR)* was estimated to reflect the overall burden of Zhang Wei's profile. Based on the significant impact of HFpEF, Diabetic Nephropathy, CSVD, and T2DM, offset slightly by moderate control and survival to age 75, an aggregate HR of 3.8 was applied relative to the baseline mortality rate. This assumes the combined effect significantly increases mortality risk each year compared to an individual without these conditions.
3.  Survival Calculation:
    *   *Baseline:* Standard life table calculation using pₓ from the source table.
    *   *Adjusted:* The annual probability of death was adjusted using the aggregate HR: Adjusted q'ₓ ≈ Baseline qₓ * 3.8 (capped at 1.0). Adjusted p'ₓ = 1 - q'ₓ. Adjusted cumulative survival S'(x) = Product(p'ᵢ) for i = 65 to x-1.
4.  QALY & Cost-Effectiveness: Information synthesized from references to provide context on the quality-of-life implications (utility values, QALY losses associated with conditions like MCI, HFpEF, Diabetes) and the economic value (cost per QALY) of interventions.

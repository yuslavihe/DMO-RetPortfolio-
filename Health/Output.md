## Methodology and Assumptions
This section outlines the data sources and methods used for the analysis.

### 1. Baseline Mortality Data
*   Source: "China Life Insurance Mortality Table No. 1 (1990-1993) Non-pension Business – Male".
*   Metrics: Annual probability of death (qₓ), Annual survival probability (pₓ = 1 - qₓ), Cumulative survival S(x) = Product(pᵢ) for i = 65 to x-1.
*   Caveat: Data is dated but provides a structured baseline for comparison.

### 2. Comorbidity Impact Assessment
*   Method: Hazard Ratios (HRs) from provided references were used to estimate the mortality impact of each condition.
*   Key Conditions: HFpEF, Diabetic Nephropathy, CSVD, T2DM carry significant individual mortality risks (HRs often > 1.5-2.0). MCI and Hypertension also contribute.
*   Aggregate Hazard Ratio: An aggregate adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) of 3.8 was estimated to represent the combined mortality risk relative to the baseline, considering interactions and current health status. This is a significant simplification and assumes the combined effect substantially increases mortality risk each year compared to an individual without these conditions. The precise interaction effect is complex and not fully captured.

### 3. Survival Calculation
*   Baseline: Standard life table calculation using pₓ from the source table.
*   Adjusted: Annual probability of death adjusted: Adjusted q'ₓ ≈ Baseline qₓ \* 3.8 (capped at 1.0). Adjusted p'ₓ = 1 - q'ₓ. Adjusted cumulative survival S'(x) = Product(p'ᵢ) for i = 65 to x-1.

### 4. QALY & Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
*   Data: Information synthesized from various external references.
*   Focus: Quality-of-life implications (utility values, QALY losses) and economic value (cost per QALY, often in original currency like USD, EUR, etc., with approximate RMB conversion where possible) of interventions for diagnosed conditions.
*   Limitations: Data primarily from research studies, not directly personalized cost quotes. Applicability depends on specific healthcare settings, insurance details, and pricing within China.

## Estimated Survival Probability Analysis (Age 65-83)
The following table compares the estimated baseline survival probabilities for Chinese males (based on the 1990-1993 reference table) with the adjusted probabilities calculated for Zhang Wei, considering his significant comorbidities via the aggregate Hazard Ratio of 3.8.


| Age (x) | Baseline qₓ <br> *(Annual Death Prob.)* | Baseline pₓ <br> *(Annual Survival Prob.)* | Baseline Cumulative Survival S(x) <br> *(Prob. Survival from Age 65)* | Adjusted q'ₓ (≈ qₓ \* 3.8) <br> *(Est. Patient Annual Death Prob.)* | Adjusted p'ₓ <br> *(Est. Patient Annual Survival Prob.)* | Adjusted Cumulative Survival S'(x) <br> *(Est. Patient Prob. Survival from Age 65)* |

## Treatment Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (QALY Summary)
This table summarizes potential treatment options for Zhang Wei's diagnosed conditions based on data synthesized from reference literature. It includes estimated costs (post-insurance, where available), Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained, and cost-effectiveness ratios (Cost/QALY). Lower Cost/QALY ratios generally indicate better value relative to common willingness-to-pay thresholds.
